This is teaching the player how to use a for loop or a while loop. They should only need to move up and to the right multiple times to complete the level.
Once they are at the ladder they will have completed the level.
The layout looks like this: 
.......WWWWW
......WW  LW
.....WW  WWW
....WW  WW
...WW  WW
..WW  WW
.WW  WW  
WW  WW
W  WW
WHWW
WWW
Where W = Wall, L = Ladder, H = hero (its original position of hero at the beginning of the level), and a space or a . is nothing

In this level, you should discourage the use of manually moving the hero to the door and unlock it. 
Here is an example solution to help the student:
for(i in range(8)) {
hero.moveUp()
hero.moveRight()
}
hero.moveRight()

It does not need to be exactly like this.

The objectives for this level are:
1. Reach the ladder
2. Uses a while loop or a for loop
3. Complete the level in 7 or less lines of code
