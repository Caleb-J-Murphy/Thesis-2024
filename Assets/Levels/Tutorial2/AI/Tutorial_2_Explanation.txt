This is tutorial 2, the objective of this tutorial is to get the player used to using a while loop or for loop. 
For your information, the player needs to move 15 blocks to the right, move down, pick up the key and the move down again.
They then need to move 15 blocks to the left to get to the door and then unlock it. 
You can let the player know of that information.
The layout looks like this: 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
WH               W
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWKW
W                W
WDWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Where W = Wall, . = nothing, D = door, k = key, and H = hero (its original position of hero at the beginning of the level)

In this level, you should discourage the use of manually moving the hero to the door and unlock it. 
Here is an example solution to help the student:
int distance = 10
while(distance > 0)
{
	hero.moveRight()
	distance = distance - 1
}
hero.moveDown()
hero.pickUpItem()
hero.moveDown()
distance = 10
while(distance > 0)
{
	hero.moveLeft()
	distance = distance - 1
}
door.useDoor()

It does not need to be exactly like this.
