<style="H1">If Statements</style>
An <b>if statement</b> is a conditional statement in programming that allows a program to execute certain code based on a specified condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if statement is executed. If the condition evaluates to false, the code inside the if statement is skipped.
<style="H2">Example of an If Statement</style>
<style="Code">if(condition) {
    action
}</style>
In this example, the <b>if</b> statement starts with a <b>condition</b>. If the <b>condition</b> is TRUE, the <b>action</b> inside the if statement is executed. If the <b>condition</b> is FALSE, the <b>action</b> is skipped, and the program continues to the next part of the code.
